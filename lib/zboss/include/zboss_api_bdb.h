   The priority of the supported methods is the following:
    1. Using Keep-Alive cluster client.
       Device checks that it supports Keep-Alive cluster client,
       then it checks that TC supports Keep-Alive cluster server.
    2. Using Poll-Control cluster server.
       According to ZCL spec, this method may be used only for ZEDs.
       It is recommended for sleepy end-devices to use this method
        because this method combines Poll Control cluster logic with TC accessibility checks.
        Note that Poll Control cluster client is mandatory for ZC devices in centralized networks.
    3. By sending ZDO Node descriptor requests periodically to TC.

   The priorities described above are equal to description in the BDB specification.

   After BDB commissioning, ZBOSS automatically selects appropriate method depending on device supported clusters
    and periodically sends messages to TC.

   If there are three failed successive polls, device will automatically rejoin current network.

 *            In case if there is no response,
